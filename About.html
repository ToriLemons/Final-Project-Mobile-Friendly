        <h4 id="item-1">2018</h4>
            <p>We all met in 2018! I need a lot of text here in order for it to show off what I want it to. I'm going to need to type a lot here. I just dont have that much to say about a hypothetical couple or group that may potentially be using this code as a blueprint for their wedding and/or future event. Technically not supposed to use lorem impsum so this---while similar in effective nonsense---is not in latin and so not a lorem. Side note i recently learned the grammatical differences between the dashes in a text. One is a hyphenation, two is in place of "through" as in January--March, and three is used for asides as seen previously. I doubt its relevence will ever come up and isn't used in general culture as far as I've seen regardless and is therefore useless knowledge.</p>
        <h4 id="item-2">2019</h4>
            <p>We started dating in 2019! I'm going to copy the same text as above to save time.  I need a lot of text here in order for it to show off what I want it to.

        <h4 id="item-3">2020</h4>
            <p>We got our own place and moved in together in 2020! I'm going to copy the same text as above to save time.  I need a lot of text here in order for it to show off what I want it to.
